==================================================

W A R N I N G:

  This code can be dangerous if you dont know what you are doing. Test this 
  on a server with a similar configuration to your production server before
  deploying.

  THIS CODE IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY EXPERTS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES.

  EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION, you have been WARNED.


Building
========

The only requirement (other than gcc, of course) is libpci:

% sudo apt-get install libpci-dev

If you don't have exactly 4 logical CPUs you need to specify how many:

% make NUM_CPUS=8


Using
=====

Simply run the binary before loading your ioatdma module:

% sudo ./force_dca
% sudo modprobe ioatdma

You should then see:

  [   72.782249] dca service started, version 1.8
  [   72.838853] ioatdma 0000:00:08.0: setting latency timer to 64
  [   72.838865] ioatdma 0000:00:08.0: Intel(R) I/OAT DMA Engine found, 4 channels, device version 0x12, driver version 3.64
  [   72.904027]   alloc irq_desc for 56 on cpu 0 node 0
  [   72.904030]   alloc kstat_irqs on cpu 0 node 0
  [   72.904039] ioatdma 0000:00:08.0: irq 56 for MSI/MSI-X

in your dmesg output.

If you see:

  [    8.367333] ioatdma 0000:00:08.0: DCA is disabled in BIOS

then either your chipset doesnt support it, or the registers live somewhere else
and you'll need to modify the code.
